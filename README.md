# Simple Python Game

A simple python game coded using the **pygame** module.
The game has:
* 3 enemy objects
* 1 Prize object
* 1 Main player

The main player can move in all directions and must avoid colliding into the enemy objects.
The player wins if he/she manages to not collide with all enemy objects or collides with the prize object only.
The player loses if there's a collision with the enemy object. The game ends thereafter.
